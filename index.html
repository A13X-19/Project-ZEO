				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<h3>Mass-Scale Aerial Drone Cargo-Military Fleet</h3>
				<p>Project ZEO is the next step towards high-grade, advanced drone technology. Funded by the International Conglomerate Reticence, ZEO is the next step towards global security and international peace between foreign powers.
					The basis behind project development it towards the prodction of a mass aerial cargo fleet able to deploy across large-scale regions over any area of land to supply governments and or cities with food, resources, equipment or military-grade tech.
					Current production cycle and development is underway, presumably to be completed around the year 2030 given the rate Reticence's production facilities preform on a daily (this also included the Conglomerate's main Branch and city-HQ, Subsidia).
					Because of this, only two know aircraft have been fully developed and are in the process of test flight and navigation-combat scenarios. They are designated ZEO-Bird 1 and Arsenal Zen 1; currently they are the only two official ZEO-Series units, as Reticence itself plans to postpone ZEO construction till the halfway mark of the Revenant Fleet's profuction has been completed.</p>

					<p> <em>"Some may view our unique business interests and development process cycles as ludicrous; impossible even. I've had benefactors and officals who have flat out told me our work will takes in a number of directions in the eyes of the people - some that many would try to strive away from. I know this, but I assure you that our intentions are concrete to the end.
						This Fleet isn't soe grandure to show what Reticence is capable; it's existence is a means to help, to show that we aren't just some manufacturing Conglomerate. Reticence is more than that, and this Fleet will prove that."</em> <b>-Matthew Reti, CEO of Reticence</b></p>
