	<h1>Welcome to Project ZEO</h1>
	<p> <p align="left">
	Project ZEO is the next step towards high-grade, advanced drone technology. Funded by the International Conglomerate Reticence, ZEO is the next step towards global security and international peace between foreign powers.</p>

		<h3>What is Zeo?</h3>
			<p>Project ZEO is the development of a highly advanced aerial fleet consisting of a series of large and small mobile aircraft capable of transporting public, government and military cargo over long-distance areas. With the development of this air fleet, codenamed Revenant, another series of aircraft designed specifically for the deployment militargy-grade aerial drone from low-orbit is also underway. These defense craft, unofficially designated as the ZEO-Series, are designed with the goal of ensuring the well-being of not just the Revenant Fleet but also any and all allied nations across the planet.</p>

			Current production cycle and development is underway, presumably to be completed around the year 2030 given the rate Reticence's production facilities preform on a daily (this also included the Conglomerate's main Branch and city-HQ, Subsidia). Because of this, only two know aircraft have been fully developed and are in the process of test flight and navigation-combat scenarios. They are designated ZEO-Bird 1 and Arsenal Zen 1; currently they are the only two official ZEO-Series units, as Reticence itself plans to postpone ZEO construction till the halfway mark of the Revenant Fleet's profuction has been completed.
